# Guia do Estudante Internacional (GEI)

The International Student Guide in Website format emerged in the context of Project Based Learning (PBL) in the first semester of the Master in Multimedia Communication. This project was suggested by a participant of the UA community and came about because the guide in PDF format is quite extensive and they would like to have something that would capture the attention of international students.

To develop this, it was necessary to think of strategies to make the text less extensive and more appealing to students. Additionally, we wanted to implement tools that would make this guide useful in the various phases that the international student may have.

To implement the project we used React, Node.js, Firebase, Redux, CSS, Bootstrap 5, UA Login and the uaveiro/ui library.
